# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-Java
A simple command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game board is a 3x3 grid where players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O'). The game checks for a win condition, a tie, or invalid moves, and displays the board after each move. The game ends when a player wins, or the board is full.
